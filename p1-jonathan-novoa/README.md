Code sample of various projects I have worked on. 

Complete repository for project 1:https://github.com/novoa-j/Revature-p1

p1-jonathan-novoa
Complete repository of the second individual project, a mock employee reimbursement system. This project focuses primarily on back-end technologies  including database persistance with JDBC, servlets and more DAO design patterns. Unlike p0, this project includes a front-end interface along with some bootstrap elements for styling.

In order to be considered a minimum viable product the project needed to fulfill all of the following criteria:
1) create a user account with a unique email and/or username
2) secure my account using a password
3) log in/log out
4) create a bank account associated with each user
5) deposit money
6) withdraw money (no negative balances!)
7) view account balance

In addition to the contraints above my project allowed for users to chage their information after creating an account and user input validation. 

Technologies: 
JDBC
Servlets
JUnit
Log4j
