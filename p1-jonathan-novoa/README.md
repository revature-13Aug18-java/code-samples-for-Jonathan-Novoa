Code sample of various projects I have worked on.

p1-jonathan-novoa
Complete repository of the second individual project, a mock employee reimbursement system. This project focuses primarily on back-end technologies  including database persistence with JDBC, servlets and more DAO design patterns. Unlike p0, this project includes a front-end interface along with some bootstrap elements for styling.

In order to be considered a minimum viable product the project needed to fulfill all of the following criteria:
create a user account with a unique email and/or username
secure my account using a password
log in/log out
create a bank account associated with each user
deposit money
withdraw money (no negative balances!)
view account balance

In addition to the constraints above my project allowed for users to change their information after creating an account and user input validation. 

Technologies: 
JDBC
Servlets
JUnit
Log4j
