# code-samples-for-Jonathan-Novoa
Code sample of various projects I have worked on. 

p1-jonathan-novoa
Complete repository of the second individual project, a minimum viable product of an employee reimbursement system. This project focuses primarily on back-end technologies  including database persistance with JDBC, servlets and more DAO design patterns. Unlike p0, this project includes a front-end interface along with some bootstrap elements for styling.
