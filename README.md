This folder holds the entire repository of the first individual assigned project, a mock banking application. This project followed the Dao design pattern and within it I have included the utility packages, object models, dao nterfaces and interface implementations.

Project Folders: 
DAO: dao interfaces and implementations
MAIN: main driver file  
MODEL: models objects
UTIL: utilities file used to get connection to the database.

Complete repository of the second individual project, a minimum viable product of an employee reimbursement system. This project focuses primarily on back-end technologies  including database persistance with JDBC, servlets and more DAO design patterns. Unlike p0, this project includes a front-end interface along with some bootstrap elements for styling.
